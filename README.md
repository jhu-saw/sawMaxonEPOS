# sawMaxonEPOS

This SAW package contains the `mtsMaxonEPOS` component, which interfaces with Maxon controllers using the EPOS Command Library over USB. To use this package, download and install the EPOS Command Library from:
  - Linux: [Version 6.8.1.0](https://www.maxongroup.com/medias/sys_master/root/8994700394526/EPOS-Linux-Library-En.zip)
  - Windows: [Version 6.8.1.0](https://www.maxongroup.com/medias/sys_master/root/8994700197918/EPOS-Windows-DLL-En.zip)

On Linux, it is necessary to install the library using the `install.sh` provided by Maxon, which creates the necessary soft-links in `/usr/lib`.

The component is designed to be generic and is configured via a JSON file.
See the [README](./core/share/README.md) in the `share` directory for details and an example.

This component supports controlling multiple controllers simultaneously. The computer communicates with the master controller via USB, and additional controllers are daisy-chained over CAN. Please refer to the hardware manual for wiring details.

**Control frequency:** TBD (to be determined through testing).

> **Note:**  
> Each EPOS controller has onboard EEPROM that stores the calibration parameters for its connected motor.  
> Calibration **must** be performed before first use. To calibrate, use Maxonâ€™s EPOS Studio. Once calibration is complete and the parameters are downloaded to the controller, no further calibration is required.

Most of the source code lives in the `core` subdirectory. A console test program is also provided as an example of usage.
